# Why a new website?

The old website was not very well suited for mobile devices, since those were less of a concern when it was created. The new website is designed to be responsive and to work well on mobile devices. It also has a new design, which is more modern and better suited for the content of the website.

# Technologies used

The new website is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator. It is written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), a lightweight markup language. It uses the PaperMod theme, which is a Hugo theme that is designed to be responsive and to work well on mobile devices. 

Our Thanks goes out to the Department of Computational Linguistics at the University of Zurich for providing us with the infrastructure to host the website.
